# Chess-Engine

This is a fully functional chess engine completely made with Python powered by Artificial Intelligence at its backend.
It uses [Mini-max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm for predicting the moves.
We have also implemented optimization techniques like\
-[Quiscence Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiescence_search)\
-[Transposition Table](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table)\
-[Alpha Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)\
We have used [Py-game](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for a user-friendly GUI.\
We have also used [Lichess-ELite-Database](https://lichess.org/team/lichess-elite-database) which served as the back-end database.\
The main library which handles the chess board is [chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Feel free to play with some functions of chess library.
Also you might wanna refer to [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) documention in-case you want to edit the window size for the application.
_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)_

After you have installed all the dependencies, you can go ahead and run the chess_main_GUI file to play the game in a small pygame window :smile:
